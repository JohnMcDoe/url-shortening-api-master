## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to work with sessionStorage
- How to create a responsive menu
- How to work with APIs

### Continued development

I'm going to take another look at Promises because this is where I was stuck for a long time. Besides that I'm also going to continue working on my Sass skills.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Whenever I was stuck this reference would be the first place where I would look for an answer. Highly recommended.
